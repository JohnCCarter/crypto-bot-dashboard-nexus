### 2. Initial Observations

> *This section captures the first-pass findings gathered during repository scanning.*

- Repository root contains both `backend` (Python) and frontend (`src`, `public`) stacks.
- Backend implements FastAPI (`backend/fastapi_app.py`) with supporting modules (`api`, `services`, `strategies`, `persistence`).
- Frontend relies on Vite, React 18, TypeScript; configuration files present (`vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`).
- Dependency management detected: `requirements.txt` (Python), `package.json` (Node).
- Testing suites: `backend/tests/` for Python (pytest) and Vitest config for frontend.

---

### 3. Cross-Domain Notes

- Mixed backend frameworks (FastAPI & Flask) suggest ongoing migration.
- Supabase/PostgreSQL indicated via `supabase_client.py` and `docker-compose.db.yml`.

### 4. Assumptions & Open Questions

1. Are Flask routes still actively used or slated for deprecation?
2. CI/CD setup unspecified; assumed via `.github/workflows` (pending review).
3. Environment variable management handled via `env.example`—need confirmation of secrets handling.

### 5. Next Steps

1. Deep-dive analysis by each agent into their domain scopes.
2. Consolidate findings, risks, and recommendations for `/finalize` report.
3. Update versioned log after each significant milestone.
