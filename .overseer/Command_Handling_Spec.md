# Command Handling Specification ‚Äì AI Overseer üåê

## Overview

This document defines how the Overseer orchestrator interprets and processes user-facing slash commands.

| Command | Purpose | Overseer Action | Log Impact | User Reply |
|---------|---------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| `/initiate` | Kick-off alignment & initial analysis phase. | ‚Ä¢ Confirm alignment  
‚Ä¢ Enumerate next internal steps  
 | Create `Version X.Y ‚Äì Alignment` section in `Overseer_Log.md`. | Explicit confirmation message only. No findings shared. |
| `/brainstorm` | Trigger agent brainstorming session. | ‚Ä¢ Run cross-domain idea generation  
‚Ä¢ Validate proposals  
 | Append `Brainstorm Notes` subsection under current version. | Respond with generic acknowledgement (e.g., ‚ÄúBrainstorming in progress.‚Äù). No details leaked. |
| `/feedback <text>` | Accept user feedback / clarifications. | ‚Ä¢ Parse text payload  
‚Ä¢ Update Assumptions & Open Questions  
‚Ä¢ Potentially spawn / retire agents | Bump minor log version & append `Feedback Integration` section. | Acknowledge feedback processed. |
| `/finalize` | Request consolidated public report. | ‚Ä¢ Collate sanitized findings  
‚Ä¢ Remove sensitive internal notes  
‚Ä¢ Generate user-facing summary | Snapshot current log ‚Üí `Overseer_Log_v<version>.md`  
Flag internal state as ‚ÄúPublished‚Äù. | Provide detailed summary markdown to user. |
| `/reset` | Full reset of overseer state. | ‚Ä¢ Archive current session to `.overseer/archive/DATE/`  
‚Ä¢ Clear in-memory structures  
‚Ä¢ Re-initialize agents | Increment major log version.  
Create fresh `Version N.0 ‚Äì Reset` header. | Confirm reset. |

## Versioning Rules

1. Semantic style **MAJOR.MINOR** where:  
   ‚Ä¢ MAJOR increments on `/reset` (global state wipe)  
   ‚Ä¢ MINOR increments on `/feedback` or large milestone (analysis, brainstorm cycles).
2. Each log snapshot must be committed to `.overseer/archive/` when finalized or reset.
3. Dates are recorded in ISO-8601.

## Internal State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Alignment : /initiate
    Alignment --> Analysis : auto
    Analysis --> Brainstorm : /brainstorm
    Brainstorm --> Analysis : agents_finish
    Analysis --> AwaitFeedback : findings_logged
    AwaitFeedback --> Analysis : /feedback
    Analysis --> Finalization : /finalize
    Finalization --> Archived : published
    Archived --> Idle : /reset
```

## Security & Privacy

- Under **no circumstance** are raw agent logs or sensitive code paths exposed unless sanitized via `/finalize`.
- All temporary working data resides in transient memory; only the markdown log is persisted.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Command detection is case-insensitive.
- Additional parameters after `/feedback` are treated as free-form markdown and inserted verbatim (after sanitization checks).
- Unrecognized commands elicit polite help text.
