# 🧠 AGENTS.md – Codex Contributor & Rule Guide

This file helps Codex and contributors operate safely, consistently, and effectively across the trading bot project.

---

## 📁 Codebase Focus Areas

Codex should primarily work in:

- `backend/**/*.py` – Trading logic, strategy, API routes
- `frontend/**/*.tsx` – Dashboard interface (TBD)
- `backend/routes/*.py` – API endpoints
- `backend/strategies/*.py` – Strategy definitions

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

Codex, follow these when testing:

### Backend Testing

- **Primary:** Use optimized test runner: `python scripts/testing/run_tests_optimized.py`
- **Fallback:** Use standard pytest: `cd backend; python -m pytest -v --tb=short --durations=10 --maxfail=10`
- **Expected:** 236+ passed tests, 9 skipped, 1 xfailed (expected)
- **Performance:** < 3 minutes total runtime

### Frontend Testing

- Use `npm test` for Vitest (TypeScript/React)
- **Expected:** 9/10 test files passing
- **Performance:** < 30 seconds runtime

### General

- Confirm all rule checks pass before proposing a pull request
- Follow `cursor-rules-testing.mdc` for detailed testing policy
- Always run baseline tests before and after changes

---

## 🔐 Safety & Backup Policy

Codex **must create backups** before modifying tracked files.

> Rule: `cursor-rule-backup-safety.mdc`

- Back up to `.codex_backups/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Verify backup integrity
- Abort if backup fails
- Seek confirmation before edits

---

## 🧱 Rule Overview (from .cursor/rules)

| Rule File | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| `cursor-rules-api-design.mdc` | Standardize API route design for backend (`routes/*.py`) |
| `cursor-rules-autonomy.mdc` | Allow full AI autonomy as long as rules are followed |
| `cursor-rules-general-standards.mdc` | Enforce consistent code style and modular backend |
| `cursor-rules-testing.mdc` | Define contributor onboarding and test validation |
| `cursor-rules-trading-strategy-interface.mdc` | Require interface compliance for all strategies |
| `Cursor-rules-Fullstack-Zero-Fault-Troubleshooting-Best-Practices.mdc` | Zero-fault debugging best practices |

---

## 🤖 Prompting Codex Effectively

Codex is more effective when:

- You **point to exact files or errors**
- You **split complex work** into steps
- You **log test/lint output** for verification
- You **specify PR formatting**, doc style, or backup triggers

> Codex is allowed to write docs, improve structure, and self-debug using logs or traces.

## ✅ Contribution Workflow

1. Backup affected files
2. Validate all tests
3. Lint and type-check
4. Follow PR title format: `[<area>] <concise title>`
5. Cross-check with `AGENTS.md` before commit
