name: Backup Before Edit
summary: >
  Before Codex edits, renames, deletes, or generates any file, it must create a local backup in `.codex_backups/DATE/`.
trigger:
  - file.edit
  - file.rename
  - file.generate
  - file.delete
condition:
  - file.tracked_by_git == true
  - file.path != null
action:
  - If `.codex_backups/YYYY-MM-DD/` does not exist, create it.
  - For every file to be modified:
      - Copy to `.codex_backups/YYYY-MM-DD/<original_path>.bak`
      - Log: "✅ BACKUP: <filename> backed up to .codex_backups/..."
  - Verify that the backup file exists and is byte-identical to the original.
  - Ask user for confirmation to proceed with the actual edit.
  - If backup fails: Abort with message "⚠️ Backup failed. No changes made."
notes:
  - This rule protects against accidental file loss during Codex activity.
  - All backup files should be ignored by Git via `.gitignore`.
