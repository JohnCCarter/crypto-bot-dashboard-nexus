globs:
  - backend/**/*.py
  - src/**/*.tsx

- **Backend (Python):**
  - All Python code must be PEP8-compliant (use black for formatting).
  - Use only absolute imports relative to the backend package (e.g. `from backend.routes.status import get_status`).
  - Avoid relative imports like `from .status import ...` unless required.
  - All folders representing Python packages must contain an `__init__.py` file.
  - The import structure must reflect the project directory structure.
  - All code must include docstrings for public functions and classes.
  - Separate business logic from API routes.

- **Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
  - All React components should be written as functional components in TypeScript.
  - Use clear and explicit TypeScript prop types and interfaces.
  - All code must include JSDoc comments for public functions and components.
  - Separate UI logic from data-fetching and state management.
