- All API endpoints must use RESTful conventions.
- Each route should have a clear summary in the docstring.
- All endpoints should validate input and handle errors gracefully.
- Responses must be returned as JSON with status codes.
- Sensitive keys (API keys, secrets) must never be exposed in logs or responses.
