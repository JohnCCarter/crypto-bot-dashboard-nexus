## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Frontend Test Fixes**

#### **Problem 1: Radix UI Select Mock Incomplete**
```
❌ Error: Cannot read property 'ItemText' of undefined
```

**Solution:**
- Added missing `ItemText` export to Radix UI Select mock
- Updated mock to include all required component exports
- Fixed test selector compatibility issues

#### **Problem 2: Missing QueryClient Provider**
```
❌ Error: useQueryClient must be used within a QueryClientProvider
```

**Solution:**
- Created `renderWithQueryClient` helper function
- Wrapped all components using React Query hooks
- Added proper QueryClient configuration for tests

#### **Problem 3: WebSocket Provider Dependencies**
```
❌ Error: useGlobalWebSocketMarket is not a function
```

**Solution:**
- Implemented comprehensive WebSocketMarketProvider mock
- Added all required WebSocket state and functions
- Provided realistic test data for market operations

#### **Problem 4: Toast Integration Missing**
```
❌ Expected toast function to be called but wasn't
```

**Solution:**
- Added `useToast` hook to ManualTradePanel component
- Implemented proper success/error toast notifications
- Updated test expectations to match actual implementation

### **Backend Integration Fixes**

#### **Critical Bug: Order History NoneType Error**
```
❌ ERROR: Failed to fetch order history: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Root Cause:**
- Bitfinex API returns order objects with `None` values for certain fields
- Code used unsafe dictionary access (`order["field"]`) instead of `.get()`
- When `order["fee"]` was `None`, attempting `.get()` on `None` caused crash

**Solution:**
```python
# Before (unsafe)
"fee": float(order.get("fee", {}).get("cost", 0)),
"timestamp": order["timestamp"],

# After (safe)
fee_data = order.get("fee") or {}
"fee": float(fee_data.get("cost") if isinstance(fee_data, dict) else 0),
"timestamp": order.get("timestamp") or 0,
```
